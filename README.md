## This is an inventory app for an imaginary computer shop as a challenge in the NodeJS section for The Odin Project curriculum.

### This project was built with:

* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* MongoDB Atlas
* Mongoose
* Bootstrap CSS and a bit of vanilla CSS
* Pug

#### This is the home page where you can see the number of categories and items that are stored in the database:

#### You can add a new category by click the button "Add a new Category", fill in the fields with a name, a description and an image url to represent the category, and finally click Add to add the new category.

#### Then you can visit the Items secction and see the items that are stored in the DB. Also if you want to add a new item, you can click the blue button "Add a new Item" and it would show you a form (similar like we did with "Categories").
